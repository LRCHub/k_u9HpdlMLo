3, 6, 9, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the
streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got
choked
And they all went to heaven in a
little rowboat
Clap, clap
Clap, snap
Clap, pat
Clap, snap
Clap, clap
Everybody dance to the music
3, 6, 9, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the
streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got
choked
And they all went to heaven in a
little rowboat
Clap, clap
Clap, snap
Clap, pat
Clap, snap
Clap, clap
Everybody dance to the music
Mama told me
She can't control me
3, 6, 9, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the
streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got
choked
And they all went to heaven in a
little rowboat
Clap, clap
Clap, snap
Clap, clap
Clap, snap
Clap, clap
Clap your hands and dance to the
music
